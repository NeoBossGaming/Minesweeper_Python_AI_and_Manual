Hello, welcome to the repo of Minsweeper_Python_AI_and_Manual
The game can be run trough the main.py script, and in there it will give a prompt, Manual or AI, pick 1 to start, by typing it in the terminal.
The AI will solve the games as many times as you want, and you can see it in action, and the final score that the AI got.
Be free to give suggestions to help me improve my coding style, efficiency, and more.
